![Project1](/assets/images/p1-DragonCave.png " Drangon Cave")
> This project tries to create a simple version of the `Drangon Cave` game.

>> Some dragons are friendly and share their treasure. Other dragons are hungry and eat anyone who enters
their cave. The player approaches two cases, one with a friendly dragon and the other with a hungry 
dragon, but does not know which dragon in in which cave.

> This project is about the `Guess the Number` game. 
>
>> The computer will _think_ of a secret number from 1 to 20 and ask the user to guess it. After each guess, the computer will tell the user 
whether the number is to high or too low. Ths user has six tries.

in the word.
