### Welcome to a GenSpark repository training projects. 
##### Version 1.0

* This repo contains several projects done during the training at GenSpark.
* All projects have been done using __java__ as platform.

![Project1](/assets/images/p1-DragonCave.png " Drangon Cave")
> This project tries to create a simple version of the `Drangon Cave` game.
>
>> Some dragons are friendly and share their treasure. Other dragons are hungry and eat anyone who enters
their cave. The player approaches two cases, one with a friendly dragon and the other with a hungry 
dragon, but does not know which dragon in in which cave.

![Project2](/assets/images/p2-GuesstheNumber.png "Guess the Number")
> This project is about the `Guess the Number` game. 
>
>> The computer will _think_ of a secret number from 1 to 20 and ask the user to guess it. After each guess, the computer will tell the user 
whether the number is to high or too low. Ths user has six tries. 


![Project3](/assets/images/p3-AddingExcepandTest-DragonCave.png "Exception and Testing to Project1")
> This project is about adding `Exception and Testing` to the _Drangon Cave_ game.
> 
>> Going back to the _Drangon Cave_ game, so we add `unit test` to this project.


![Project4](/assets/images/p4-Testing-p1.png "Exception and Testing to Project1")
> This project is about adding `Exception and Testing` to the _Guess the Number_ game.
> 
>> Going back to the _Guess the Number_ game, so we add `unit test` to this project.


![Project5](/assets/images/p5-Hangman.png "Hangman")
> This project is about the `Hangman` game.
> 
>> Hangman is a game for two people in wich on _player_ (in our case the computer) thinks of a word and then draws
a blank on the page for each letter in the word. The second player then tries to guess letter thet might be
in the word.

>> We add `unit test` to this project.


![Project6](/assets/images/p6-HumansVSGoblins.png "Humans VS Goblins")
> This project is about the `Humans VS Goblins`game.
> Here are some of the conditions:
> 
>> Everything must be objects: land/goblins/humans.
>> You must override the toString method to represent each of the object.
>> Create a grid for the game world.
>> Use UTF characters for the players and globins and the land.
>> Game is turn based move: n/s/e/w.

>> We added `unit test` to this project.

![Project7](/assets/images/p7-Hangmanfunctional.png "Hangman Functional")
> This project is based on the `Hangman` game in Project5, but functional now.
> Here are some conditions:
> 
>> The art for hangman should be read from a file, this art connotates that
  the estate of the game.
>> The user should be able to enter their name, where their name and score will be
  recorded to a file after each game.
>> The game will tell the user if they have high score or not.
>> No exceptions are allowed, all exceptions must be caught by the program.

>> We added `unit test` to this project.

![Project8](/assets/images/p8-HumansVSGoblinsRedux.png "Humans VS Goblins Redux")
> This project is based on the `Humans VS Goblins` game in Project6. Now adding GUI.
> Here are some conditions:
> 
>> Adding a GUI to the Humans vs Goblins project.
>> Use a GUI of your choice.
>> Add unit testing, and exception handling where appropiate.
